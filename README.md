Brief Project Description: I will be making a game of Chess Puzzles (similar to the puzzle section of chess.com). I will hopefully have a timer, a series of puzzles (or levels), orientation options, and a section for marking your "correctness."

Expanded Descriptions:
Critical Features: Chess board with movable pieces that follow the rules of chess; series of predetermined chess boards with pre-determined solutions to puzzles.
Nice to have: timer, “correctness” tracker, and orientation options.
